    <p class="teach">and I am teaching myself HTML and CSS!</p>
    <div class="cover">
      <p>A little about myself:</p>
      <p>I have worked since I was 16 years old in the customer service industry, mainly movie theaters. After Covid hit, that industry, that I loved and felt like I had done most of what I could do in, pretty much went downhill. I decided it was time for a change for my career. I left the theater industry behind and took a job as a janitor while I decided what I would want to accomplish next. A little after a year, and some encouragement from a friend in the field, I decided to try front-end web development. My friend sent me some resources for me to learn and I found out that I enjoy it.</p>
      <p>Things that I enjoy about coding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating something from nothing</li>
          <li>Figuring out solutions to get the job done</li>
          <li>Teaching myself new skills</li>
          <li>Seems like there is always something new to learn</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I have only been learning coding for a little while but I have been enjoying the rush I get from finishing a project. Especially  if I can figure out how to fix an issue. I am a quick learner and a driven individual. I loving getting a project to work on and will stay focused until it is done. I have been a manager in most places I have worked, so I understand the need to work in a team. During my time at the Paris Theater, I lead many projects including setting up a Point of Sale system, sitting up online tickets sales, and all of the nightly and monthly paperwork that the company still uses to this day.</p>
      <p>I am looking forward to starting my new career and hope to hear back from you soon!</p>
